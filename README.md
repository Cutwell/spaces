# Hotcorners
 Mac OSX hotcorners for Windows 10

# Setting up
- Download spaces and unpack into your desired installation folder.
- Create a virtual environment using `python3 -m virtualenv venv`.
- Activate the environment using `.\venv\Scripts\activate`.
- Install project dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (installs pyautogui and dependencies).
- Run `settings.vbs` to edit your desired hot corner settings, and to add spaces to your startup programs.
- You can also try out spaces without installation by running `spaces.pyw` from this folder.

# Troubleshooting
- After moving your install directory, you must update the start menu installation by pressing the 'add program to startup' button again.

# Uninstall
- To remove spaces from your system manually, simply delete the install directory and `C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\spaces.vbs`
